# Tic-Tac-Toe
The Tic-Tac-Toe project made using HTML, CSS, and JS is a simple web-based game that allows two players to compete against each other in the classic game of tic-tac-toe. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where each player takes turns placing their symbol (either X or O) on the board until one player gets three of their symbols in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

Overall, the Tic-Tac-Toe project is a great example of how HTML, CSS, and JS can be used together to create a fun and interactive game that is both easy to play and visually appealing.
